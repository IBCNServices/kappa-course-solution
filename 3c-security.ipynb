    "Notice that for this query, we're using outputmode `complete` instead of `append`. This is because `append` mode can never change a row in the result table once it's written. However, Spark does not know when all events of a certain window have been seen. Spark assumes by default that data can be \"late\", meaning an earlier event can enter the stream _after_ a later event has entered. In `complete` mode, rows are written to the result table immediately when they become available and they are updated once new data arrives.\n",

With a watermark, you specify how \"late\" data can be.\n",
